# Big Data in Marketing 


The subject of our project was : 
# Image Classification

- With a dataset of food/drinks/brands/logos, create a multilabel image classification model using any pretrained model (e.g. VGG16, InceptionV3, EfficientDet/EfficientNet, etc.)

- Minimum requirements: find/collect and, if needed, annotate enough data for at least 3 classes; use built-in data augmentation functions (e.g. from tensorflow); use transfer learning techniques to train a model; evaluate it on test data; provide and explain how can you apply this model in marketing/market research field to find insights from pictures

- Desirable: Use Albumenatations for image augmentation (example); make some photos and test your model on them; test your model on random pictures of landscapes/inside-outside environments/etc; provide possible marketing ideas of it.
